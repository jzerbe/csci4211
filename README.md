csci4211 assignments
========

This repo contains code assignments for the
University of Minnesota Computer Science class 4211 -
[Introduction to Computer Networks](http://www-users.cselabs.umn.edu/classes/Fall-2011/csci4211/),
which I took Fall 2011 semester.

Not really good work, just trying to hit due
dates and make it readable enough to get the grade.
